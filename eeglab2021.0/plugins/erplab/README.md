
ERPLAB Toolbox is a free, open-source Matlab package for analyzing ERP data.  It is tightly integrated with [EEGLAB Toolbox](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/), extending EEGLAB’s capabilities to provide robust, industrial-strength tools for ERP processing, visualization, and analysis.  A graphical user interface makes it easy for beginners to learn, and Matlab scripting provides enormous power for intermediate and advanced users.

To install ERPLAB v8.0, download the zip file (linked above), unzip and place the folder in the 'plugins' folder of your existing [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php) installation (e.g.  `/Users/Steve/Documents/MATLAB/eeglab2019_1/plugins/erplab/`). More [installation help can be found here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Installation).

To run ERPLAB, ensure that the correct EEGLAB folder is in your current Matlab path, and run `eeglab` as a command from the Matlab Command Window. [Find our tutorial here.](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Tutorial)

We encourage most users to use this latest major version.

## ERPLAB compatibility

We anticipate that ERPLAB will work with most recent OSs, Matlab versions and EEGLAB versions.


- The Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox is required
  - Entering in the command `ver` in the Command Window will produce a list of installed toolboxes. Check this list to see whether the Signal Processing Toolbox is installed
- [EEGLAB v12 or later](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php) is recommended.

## ERPLAB v8.0 Release Notes

With ERPLAB v8.0, we include new tools for [assessing measures of Data Quality Metrics in EEG ERP data](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-Data-Quality-Metrics).

- Data Quality Metrics
   - The ERP Averager will calculate these Data Quality Metrics by default
   - A new submenu in the ERPLAB menu ('Data Quality options') allows access from the EEGLAB-ERPLAB GUI.
   - A new table interface to show all the data quality information from an ERP set with `DQ_Table_GUI(ERP)` or through the above GUI menu option.
   - These data quality metrics can be summarized on the Command Window, saved to Mat structure or exported to Excel, or plotted in the above interactive table.
   - The data quality information and metadata is stored in a new structure, ERP.dataquality
<br/>

- New options for calculating, viewing, and saving, frequency spectra, in the `compute_fourier(EEG)` [function](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Generate-Frequency-Spectra)

<br/>

- Various [bugfixes](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/commits/master)

- Older [release Notes can be found here](https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/wiki/Release-Notes)
