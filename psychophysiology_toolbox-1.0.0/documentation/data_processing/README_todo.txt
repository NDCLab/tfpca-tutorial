List of things to do -- Wish list 

- Greek letters across for microvolts, etc. 

- Use VerticalAlignment and HorizontalAlignment parameters to control position in review_components, instead of the method currently used (adding numerical offsets).  

- Variability measure added to components, like was added to tag_artifacts 

- review_components - allow selecting negative time values 


- Make data structure TOTALLY consistent across indiv subject files and
  average and trial files -- e.g. subnum, subs, original_format, and scaled2uV
