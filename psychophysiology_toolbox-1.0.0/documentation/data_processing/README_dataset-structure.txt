DATASET Structure (same as produced by psychophys_data2mat)  

  INDIVIDUAL subject files - as produced by psychophys_data2mat  
                             (the usual level of data to start with)  

  1 - DATA matrix 

        erp.data       - main data array, trial/sweeps in rows, 
                         timepoints in columns   

  2 - INDEX vectors - vertical vectors, same length as number of rows in erp.data. 
                  Values index contents of each row in erp.data  

      Critical index vectors - valid data required
        Used by several toolbox scripts:

        erp.elec       - electrode index
        erp.sweep      - trial/sweep index
                         (does not need to be continuous -- e.g. 1, 2, 5, 9, 30 is ok).

      SWEEP index vectors - identify various attributes of the sweeps
        Valid data NOT required for these (e.g. can be all zeros)

        erp.ttype      - 'trigger type' - stimulus type index
        erp.correct    - correct/incorrect response index
        erp.accept     - accept/reject trial index
        erp.rt         - reaction time index
        erp.response   - subject response index

      Optional stimulus/condition index variable for extra index vectors:

        erp.stim       - put any additional index vectors here as sub-variables.

  3 - PARAMETERS - various required parameters of the dataset

        erp.tbin            - 'trigger bin' - bin of time zero, bin of stimulus delivery
        erp.elecnames       - names of electrodes in rows, 10 chars wide (row # = elec #)
        erp.samplerate      - samplreate scalar
        erp.original_format - text field marking the binary format data was converted from
                              (e.g. when imported from Neuroscan using the ns2mat scripts,
                              the 'neuroscan-eeg' value is used for scaling NS files to uV during run)

  AGGREGATE files across subjects (usually generated by the toolbox)  
    The following are additional variables required when creating average and trial files by hand instead of having extract_trials and extract_averages make them.  The reason for wanting to do this is to use the plotting and component picking scripts on data that is already aggregated across subjects.  These are created automatically when avg/trial file is created by toolbox.  
 
  1 - INDEX vectors - same size/purpose as index variables above 

      erp.subnum     - INDEX vector with subject number of each row in erp.data 

  2 - PARAMETERS  

      erp.domain     - specifies domain - text field containing 'time' or 'freq'
