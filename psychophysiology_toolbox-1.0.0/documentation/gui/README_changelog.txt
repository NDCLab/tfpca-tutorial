	Fixed pop_File_Select.m to accommodate files with no periods in them
	Fixed setting of Save_Dir in pop_Get_Components.m
	Fixed mishandling of empty lists in pop_Add_Stim.m and pop_Add_Stim_Trials.m
	Fixed functions so that they no longer crash if script can't be written

0.9.4:	The Mad Hatter, aka Stephen's initial workouts

	Changed pop_Import_Data to permit concurrent use of epoch, rereference, filter, and add .stim functions
	If selected, functions are executed in order listed above

	BACKEND REWRITES
	Changed how GUI function parameters are stored

	    For pop_Tag_Artifacts-based functions: gui_parameters.function_name.specific_definition.parameter
	Avoids cluttering up base workspace with tons of variables
	Also allows for saving of current state by saving gui_parameters variable into default_gui_parameters.mat file

	Fixed initial generation of artifact criteria in pop_Tag_Artifacts.m
	Made script that's output from pop_Tag_Artifacts.m more elegant
	Modified the following functions to handle printing AT structures into scripts:
