CSD Toolbox

Version 1.1 (July 21, 2010)

The CSD toolbox provides a MatLab implementation of a spherical spline algorithm (Perrin et al., 1989) to compute scalp surface Laplacian or current source density (CSD) estimates for surface potentials (EEG/ERP). Its successful use requires basic knowledge of (or willingness to learn about) electrophysiologic principles (e.g., EEG montage, 10-20-system, volume conduction) and rudimentary mathematics (e.g., fundamental algebra and geometry), as well as access to and basic knowledge of MatLab® software. Without these prerequisites, the use of the CSD toolbox is strongly discouraged.
