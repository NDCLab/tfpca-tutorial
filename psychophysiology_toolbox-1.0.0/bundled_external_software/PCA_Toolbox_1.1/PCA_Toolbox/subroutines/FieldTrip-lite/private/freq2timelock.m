function [timelock, cfg] = freq2timelock(cfg, freq);

% FREQ2TIMELOCK  transform the frequency data into something
% on which the timelocked source reconstruction methods can
% perform their trick.
%
% This function also performs frequency and channel selection, using
%   cfg.frequency
%   cfg.channel
%
% After source reconstruction, you should use TIMELOCK2FREQ.

% Revision 1.4  2006/05/10 08:19:45  roboos
% added dimord to the output
%
% Revision 1.3  2006/02/23 10:28:17  roboos
% changed dimord strings for consistency, changed toi and foi into time and freq, added fixdimord where neccessary
%
% Revision 1.2  2006/02/01 12:26:04  roboos
% made all uses of dimord consistent with the common definition of data dimensions, see the fixdimord() function
%
% Revision 1.1  2005/10/14 15:50:08  roboos
% new implementation, used by dipolefitting in case of frequency or ICA data
