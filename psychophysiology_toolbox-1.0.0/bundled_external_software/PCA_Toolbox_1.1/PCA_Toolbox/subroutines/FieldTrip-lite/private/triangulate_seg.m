function [pnt, tri] = triangulate_seg(seg, npnt, ori);

% TRIANGULATE_SEG constructs a triangulation of the outer surface of a
% segmented volume. It starts at the center of the volume and projects the
% vertices of an evenly triangulated sphere onto the outer surface. The
% resulting surface is star-shaped from the center of the volume.
%
% Use as
%   [pnt, tri] = triangulate_seg(seg, npnt)
