%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUBFUNCTION that converts a freq structure into Cf, Cr and Pr

% This function returns data matrices with a channel order that is consistent

% Revision 1.20  2006/10/30 16:37:29  roboos
% fixed bug in reshaping of fourier data (was ctranspose, whereas it should be normal transpose), all phase differences in the CSD matix were therefore defined the other way around
% added support for Cr and Pr (needed for dics) in case fourier input data
%
% Revision 1.19  2006/10/02 13:02:27  roboos
% fixed bug for rpttap_chan_freq_time, where the 'tap' part was dropped from the dimord
%
% Revision 1.18  2006/03/08 15:31:14  roboos
% removed default cfg.channel=all, since no channelselection is done inside this function
%
% Revision 1.17  2006/02/23 10:28:17  roboos
% changed dimord strings for consistency, changed toi and foi into time and freq, added fixdimord where neccessary
%
% Revision 1.16  2006/02/10 09:15:30  jansch
% changed some chancmb which were missed during last fix
%
% Revision 1.15  2006/02/10 09:12:15  jansch
% changed _chancmb in the dimord into _chan
%
% Revision 1.14  2006/02/01 12:26:04  roboos
% made all uses of dimord consistent with the common definition of data dimensions, see the fixdimord() function
%
% Revision 1.13  2005/08/26 14:56:27  roboos
% selection of tbin in freq.toi was done twice, resulting in error
%
% Revision 1.12  2005/08/26 13:39:02  roboos
% changed the indentation throughout the code, no functional changes
%
% Revision 1.11  2005/08/25 08:05:42  jansch
% removed support for fourier in case of average, since that does not make sense
% added support for multiple tapers in computation of CSD from fourier input
%
% Revision 1.10  2005/08/16 13:16:24  jansch
% *** empty log message ***
%
% Revision 1.9  2005/08/16 12:47:57  jansch
% made change to also support input dimord of 'rpttap_sgncmb_frq'
%
% Revision 1.8  2005/08/15 13:30:50  jansch
% removed the normalisation for the number of samples, when computing the cross-
% spectra from the fourierspctrum: TAKE CARE! this is not backward-compatible
%
% Revision 1.7  2005/05/20 16:50:26  roboos
% added normalisation of the CSD matrix computed from the fourier spectra
%
% Revision 1.6  2005/05/17 18:01:21  roboos
% changed all "if" occurences of & and | into && and ||
% this makes the code more compatible with Octave and also seems to be in closer correspondence with Matlab documentation on shortcircuited evaluation of sequential boolean constructs
% added cfg.dicsfix for taking conjugate of csd from MEG to reference channel (default)
% implemented computation of csd from single trial fourier spectrum (if freqanalysis with output=fourier)
%
% Revision 1.5  2005/03/03 10:59:29  roboos
% Added cfg as output argument and added selected chanels to the output
% cfg, so that the calling function knows which were selected. Renamed
% tbin into timebin.
%
% Revision 1.4  2005/02/16 15:13:50  roboos
% renamed cfg.refchannel into cfg.refchan, replaced detection of coh_refchan submethod for dics (now looking for presence of cfg.refchan instead of explicitely testing the submethod)
%
% Revision 1.3  2004/08/26 12:43:22  roboos
% fixed bug in backward-compatibility code for sgn/sgncmb
%
% Revision 1.2  2004/08/25 17:00:08  roboos
% changed from sgn/sgncmb to label/labelcmb, backward compatible
%
% Revision 1.1  2004/06/28 08:59:38  roboos
% moved files from fieldtrip to fieldtrip/private
