function [hdr] = read_biosig_header(filename)

% READ_BIOSIG_HEADER reads header from EEG file using the BIOSIG
% toolbox and returns it in the FCDC framework standard format
%
% Use as
%  [hdr] = read_biosig_header(filename)
%
% The following data formats are supported: EDF, BKR, CNT, BDF, GDF,
% see for full documentation http://biosig.sourceforge.net/

% Revision 1.2  2004/03/11 10:18:57  roberto
% fixed bug in number of samples (should be the same in all channels)

% Revision 1.1  2004/03/10 11:50:31  roberto
% new implementation of wrapper functions around the BIOSIG toolbox (specifically section T200)

% the BIOSIG header is defined in full detail below
% the FCDC header should at least contain the following fields
%   hdr.Fs           sampling frequency
%   hdr.nChans       number of channels
%   hdr.nSamples     number of samples per trial
%   hdr.nSamplesPre  number of pre-trigger samples in each trial
%   hdr.nTrials      number of trials
%   hdr.label        cell-array with labels of each channel

  error('channels with different sampling rates are not supported');
