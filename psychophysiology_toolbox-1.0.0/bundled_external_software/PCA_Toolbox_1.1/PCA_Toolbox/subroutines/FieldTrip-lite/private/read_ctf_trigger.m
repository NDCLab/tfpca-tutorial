function [backpanel, frontpanel] = read_ctf_trigger(dataset)

% READ_CTF_TRIGGER reads the STIM channel from a dataset and detects
% the trigger moments and values
%
% [backpanel, frontpanel] = read_ctf_trigger(dataset)
% 
% This returns all samples of the STIM channel, converted to backpanel
% and frontpanel trigger values. Triggers are placed at the rising flank
% of the STIM channel.
%
% Triggers should be at least 9 samples long (for 1200Hz samplerate) and
% should not overlap each other.

% added support for triggers in UPPT001, USPT001, UTRG001 (thanks to Tom)

% Revision 1.7  2004/03/12 11:21:19  roberto
% The function outputs backpanel and frontpanel seperately. However
% it performs the upflank/kernel-convolution-correction of the
% trigger-channel on the the full 32-bit data. Usually the frontpanel
% is used to record responses while the backpanel is used for recording
% stimulus-trigger. While the timecourse of backpanel-triggers can
% be fully controlled the temporal overlap of these triggers with
% subject-responses can not. Therefore I think read_ctf_trigger should
% do the correction on the splitted data as done in the attached
% version of the function. This version works as before for nonoverlapping
% cases but can also handle backpanel-frontpanel overlap.
%
% Revision 1.6  2004/02/18 13:55:39  roberto
% fixed most significant bit, which was messed up by reading the data as signed int
%
% Revision 1.5  2004/02/12 09:55:35  roberto
% fixed bug, length of trigger was trigshift samples too short
%
% Revision 1.4  2003/10/14 12:37:17  roberto
% made teh trigshift adaptive to sampling frequency
%
% Revision 1.3  2003/09/12 09:27:11  roberto
% added comment to help about how triggers are supposed to behave
%
% Revision 1.2  2003/05/21 10:59:52  roberto
% fixed bugs in front/backpanel
%
% Revision 1.1  2003/05/19 14:40:32  roberto

% read the stimulus channel from raw CTF data: with the new electronics
% control console used at NIH, there is now no longer any channel
% named "STIM". Instead, there are a variety of channel names. The
