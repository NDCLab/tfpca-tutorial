function write_data(filename, dat, varargin)

% WRITE_DATA exports electrophysiological data to a file
%
% Use as
%   write_data(filename, dat, ...)
%
% The specified filename can already contain the filename extention,
% but that is not required since it will be added automatically.
%
% Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
%   'header'         header structure, see READ_FCDC_HEADER
%   'dataformat'     string, see below
%   'chanindx'       1xN array
%   'subformat'      string, for the fcdc_ftc format
%
% The supported dataformats are
%   brainvision_eeg
%   neuralynx_ncs
%   plexon_nex
%   fcdc_matbin
%   fcdc_ftc
%   riff_wave
%   matlab
