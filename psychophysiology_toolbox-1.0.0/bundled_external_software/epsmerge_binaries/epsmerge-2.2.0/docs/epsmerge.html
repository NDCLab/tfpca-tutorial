<P>epsmerge -- a program for merging encapsulated postscript files.</P>
<P>This file documents version 2.2.0 of epsmerge.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> [<EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM>] [<STRONG>--</STRONG>] <EM>file-1</EM> <EM>file-2</EM> ...</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> is a program that merges several EPS files into one
big EPS file.  The original files are untouched.  (Unless your output
file is also one of the input files; don't do that :-)</P>
<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> is provided AS IS copyrighted under the GNU GPL.
Be sure to read the copyright section if you do not know what this
means.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="options">OPTIONS</A></H1>
<P>An option is a string telling epsmerge how to behave; each option begins
with '-' (called short options) or '--' (called long options).  Usually,
an option should be followed by a single value (could be a number, a
string, or a filename or something else), but some options need not have
any value (they will then take a default value) or could have more than
one.</P>
<P>There <EM>must</EM> be a space separating the option from its value.  The value
may not contain whitespaces (unless the entire value is quoted).</P>
<P>Short options are case sensitive (i.e., <STRONG>-O</STRONG> is not equivalent to <STRONG>-o</STRONG>),
but the long ones are case insensitive (<STRONG>--orientation</STRONG> is equivalent to
<STRONG>--orIeNtAtIon</STRONG>).</P>
<P>Note that if you <EM>don't</EM> specify an option on the command line when
invoking epsmerge, then the value in your configuration file will be
used.  Except if there isn't any specified in the configuration file (or
there is no configuration file); then an internal default will be used.
Most of the information about the options below also tells you what
the internal default is.</P>
<P>Note also that a <STRONG>--</STRONG> (two dashes) by itself signifies the end of the
option list.  You can use this, e.g., if you want to specify '-'
(standard input) as the first input file.  (Or if the first input file
is called '-rf', cf. Larry Wall's comment :-)</P>
<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> currently understands the following options:</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="options: version and help">Options: Version and help</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>-h</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--help</STRONG></P>
<P>Causes <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> to print out a usage message, and then stop.</P>
<P><STRONG>-v</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--version</STRONG></P>
<P>Causes <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> to print a version string (one line) and then
stop.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="options: general options">Options: general options</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>--font</STRONG></P>
<P>This option specifies the font to be used to print labels and headers
(see below).  The value should be a case-sensitive string.  It is passed
uncritically into the generated file, so please make sure that your
postscript interpreter/printer knows the font.  Default value is
'Times-Roman'.</P>
<P><STRONG>--header</STRONG></P>
<P>This option writes a header (which could be at the bottom of the page).  See
section <A HREF="#how to write labels">How to write labels</A> for how to specify the header string.</P>
<P><STRONG>--labels</STRONG></P>
<P>Use this option to print labels for each EPS file.  See section
<A HREF="#how to write labels">How to write labels</A> for how to specify the label string.</P>
<P><STRONG>-o</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--output-file</STRONG></P>
<P>This option tells <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> to write its output to the specified file.
Otherwise, the default is to write to standard output.  Which you can then
pipe on to your favourite printer (but you may want to see <A HREF="#examples of usage">Examples of usage</A>
below).  And the <STRONG>--print</STRONG> switch.  However, if you generate multiple files
(see <A HREF="#how to generate multiple files">How to generate multiple files</A>) then the filename you specify
will only be used to <EM>derive</EM> the names of the output files.</P>
<P><STRONG>-O</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--orientation</STRONG></P>
<P>Orientation means that the paper should be turned 90 degrees.  The value following
should be `Landscape' or `Portrait', or just `L' or `P' (case unimportant).  The
default value is Portrait.</P>
<P><STRONG>-p</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--paper</STRONG></P>
<P>Paper specifies the paper size.  Normally for an EPS file the size of
the bounding box doesn't really matter (since it will probably be rescaled anyway
when included in some document).  But if you want to send it to a printer
then it matters.  Default is A4 (this can easily be changed in the script,
though), and the currently recognized sizes are: A2, A3, A4, A5, B4, B5,
letter, tabloid, ledger, legal, and executive.  See also '-pw' and '-ph'.</P>
<P><STRONG>-ph</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--paper-height</STRONG></P>
<P>Specifies the height of the paper directly.  Should be used with <STRONG>-pw</STRONG>.
As with all distances, the width may be given in postscript points, centimetres,
millimetres, or inches.</P>
<P><STRONG>-pw</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--paper-width</STRONG></P>
<P>Specifies the width of the paper directly.  Should be used with <STRONG>-ph</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>-ps</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>--postscript</STRONG></P>
<P>Causes epsmerge to produce a postscript file (non-encapsulated).  The
biggest difference is that a postscript file (unlike EPS) can contain
several pages, so if you format more than one page (see section <A HREF="#how to generate multiple files">How to generate multiple files</A>), you will get them all in one postscript file.
This option automatically implies <STRONG>--print</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>--print</STRONG></P>
<P>This option can be useful when printing an EPS file directly; it causes
the '%%EOF' DSC to be preceded with the otherwise illegal 'showpage'
operator, which is necessary since the printers I know will otherwise
happily ignore everything.  You will still need to pipe the output to
the printer yourself, though.</P>
<P><STRONG>--script</STRONG></P>
<P>This option allows you to specify a Perl script that will generate a
label for you, one for each label specifier (see <A HREF="#how to write labels">How to write labels</A>)
that contains the specifier letter <STRONG>s</STRONG>.  The script should return a one
line string (either as returned by the last statement, or by an explicit
<EM>return</EM> statement).  If you do not specify a script on the command
line, then epsmerge will prompt you for a script every time it needs to
format something with a label; if you just press return then it will
take the last script also as the current script.  Inside the script, the
following variables are at your disposal: $f is the current filename, $n
is the number of the current label, starting with the zeroth (if you
specify both <STRONG>--header</STRONG> and <STRONG>--labels</STRONG> then the header label will be
the last), and $l is the number of times the script has been run for the
current label (again starting with zero).  This means that if you
specify, say, <STRONG>sss</STRONG> as the value to <STRONG>--labels</STRONG>, then your script will
be called three times for each label, with $l equal to, respectively, 0,
1, and 2 for each call.  See <A HREF="#examples of usage">Examples of usage</A>.  Oh, and be sure that
your script is enclosed in quotes if typed on the command line, just as
you would when running <STRONG>perl -e</STRONG> (in the configuration file just type
the script as any normal perl program (block)).</P>
<P><STRONG>--ignore-eof</STRONG></P>
<P>This option causes the reader to ignore the %%EOF DSC which normally marks
the end of a postscript file.  Default is to use them.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="options: formatting options, standard formatter">Options: formatting options, standard formatter</A></H2>
<P>These options are the ones understood by the default formatter.  This
formatter places things in rows and columns of <EM>cells</EM>.  Imagine each
page as a matrix made of cells each of the same size, and normally
(modulo the <STRONG>-prs</STRONG> and <STRONG>-par</STRONG> options, see below) images are formatted
to fit each into one cell (in the order they are given on the command
line, but see also the <STRONG>-rmo</STRONG> option).</P>
<P>Option values that specify a distance may be specified in postscript
points (1/72th of an inch), centimetres, millimetres, or inches, and
they may be negative.  Examples: '42', '0.1cm', '-42mm', '3.6in'.
Normally you would not type the quotes; note that there is no space
between the number and the unit.  For boolean options (true/false), the
value is optional, but true values can be specified as 'yes', 'y', '1',
'true', 't', whereas the false ones are 'no', 'n', '0', 'f', 'false',
'nil', '``'''.  The default is (usually) true.</P>
<P><STRONG>-x</STRONG></P>
<P>The number following the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> switch specifies how many cells you want
in a row.</P>
<P><STRONG>-y</STRONG></P>
<P>Like <STRONG>-x</STRONG>, but how many cells you want in each column.  You may specify
either, both, or none, of <STRONG>-x</STRONG> and <STRONG>-y</STRONG>; if you specify none then the
formatter will make an (educated) guess.</P>
<P><STRONG>-lmar</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>-rmar</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>-tmar</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>-bmar</STRONG></P>
<P>These options specify the margins (left, right, top, and bottom, respectively).
If not specified, they default to 20 (postscript points).</P>
<P><STRONG>-xcs</STRONG></P>
<P>X Cell Spacing.  Says how much space you want between each cell in the
horizontal direction.  You may specify a negative value if you wish.  The
default value is 20 (postscript points).</P>
<P><STRONG>-ycs</STRONG></P>
<P>Y Cell Spacing.  Analogous to the <STRONG>-xcs</STRONG> option (qv).</P>
<P><STRONG>-rmo</STRONG></P>
<P>Row major order.  If true (this is the default, too) then the cells will
be set with <EM>rows</EM> first (starting with the first EPS file you
specified, then the next, etc), filling out the top row first.  If the
value is false, then the <EM>columns</EM> will be set one at a time, starting
with the leftmost.</P>
<P><STRONG>-par</STRONG></P>
<P>Preserve Aspect Ratio.  If true, then the formatter will preserve the
aspect ratio of the cells by (if necessary) compressing them even
further.</P>
<P><STRONG>-prs</STRONG></P>
<P>Preserve Relative Size.  If true, then the formatter will preserve the
relative sizes of the cells by (if necessary) compressing them even
further.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="formatting options, stacking formatter">Formatting options, stacking formatter</A></H2>
<P>This formatter is a rather simple one which simply stacks its images in
either the horizontal or the vertical direction (but currently not
both).  Images are scaled so that the sides where they meet have the
same lengths.</P>
<P><STRONG>--stack</STRONG></P>
<P>Boolean.  This option activates the stacking formatter, rather than the
default one.</P>
<P><STRONG>-x</STRONG></P>
<P>Same as for the standard formatter; says to format cells horizontally.
Note that if you want more pages with the stacked formatter, you should
specify both <STRONG>-x</STRONG> and <STRONG>-y</STRONG> (one of which should be 1), e.g.,</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o foo.ps -x 4 -y 1 file-1 [..] file-8</PRE>
<P>(This is a bug)</P>
<P><STRONG>-y</STRONG></P>
<P>The moral equivalent of <STRONG>-x</STRONG> (qv).</P>
<P><STRONG>-cs</STRONG></P>
<P>Cell spacing.  This tells how much distance there should be between two
images.  The default is zero, and it can be negative.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="how to write labels">How to write labels</A></H1>
<P>Two options, namely the <STRONG>--header</STRONG> and <STRONG>--labels</STRONG> options, allow you
to write a label for, respectively, the entire generated EPS file and
for each included EPS file.  The option (if present) should be followed
by a string which specifies what to print as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The first letter should be `a', `t' or `b', stating that the labels should be written
above (top) or below (bottom) the image of the EPS file.  You may omit this letter;
by default <STRONG>--labels</STRONG> writes labels <EM>below</EM> its EPS file, and <STRONG>--header</STRONG> writes
its labels <EM>above</EM> the EPS files.
<P></P>
<LI>
Each of the following letters specifies that the label should contain one line
of information as follows:
<P><STRONG>d</STRONG>:
The letter `d' says to include the creation date for the EPS file.  For
the <STRONG>--header</STRONG> option, this just means the time when epsmerge is run,
written in standard (UNIX) time format.  For the <STRONG>--labels</STRONG> option,
this is read from the EPS file's DSC if it has one, otherwise epsmerge
reads the last time the file was modified.</P>
<P><STRONG>f</STRONG>:
The letter `f' says to write the filename (of the EPS file or the generated file).
For the generated file, if you haven't given a filename (via the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> option),
`stdout' is written.</P>
<P><STRONG>F</STRONG>:
The letter `F' does the same as `f' except that the file's extension (if present)
is stripped.  So if your file is called <EM>foo.eps</EM>, only <EM>foo</EM> is written.</P>
<P><STRONG>i</STRONG>:
The letter `i' tells epsmerge to prompt you for a one line label (only
if run interactively).  If you want more than one line as a label, just
specify as many `i's in your label string as you want.</P>
<P><STRONG>s</STRONG>:
The letter `s' says that epsmerge should run your Perl script to
generate a one line label.  Normally you would specify the script with
the <STRONG>--script</STRONG> option (qv), but if you don't, epsmerge will prompt you
for a script every time it wants one.  If you type a script once and
would like epsmerge to use it next time it prompts you, then just press
return at the prompt.</P>
<P><STRONG>T</STRONG>:
The letter `T' says to include the title of the EPS file (this is given in the
EPS file's DSC -- if not, it's ignored).</P>
<P>If you omit <EM>all</EM> of these letters, then some default is assumed.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
As the final information in the label string you may write a number, specifying the
required font size.  The default for <STRONG>--labels</STRONG> is 12, the default for <STRONG>--header</STRONG>
is 20.
<P></P></OL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="the configuration file">The configuration file</A></H1>
<P>As of version 1.2.0, you can now write a configuration file specifying
your favourite options and their values.  Create a file called .epsmergerc
and put it somewhere in Perl's include path (next to the .pm files would
be good).  Or you can put it in your home directory.  Also, you can put
it in the current working directory, and this will be checked first.  This
allows you to have a per-project configuration file, assuming that you keep
each project in a separate directory.</P>
<P>Each line of the file may be:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
A blank line, or
<P></P>
<LI>
A comment line: these begin with a `#' character and the rest of the line
will then be ignored (really; there is no backslash continuation), or
<P></P>
<LI>
A line consisting of <EM>option</EM>=<EM>value</EM> or <EM>option</EM>: <EM>value</EM>.  The
option is just the long or short option name with the leading '-' or
'--' stripped off (this method was chosen to make it easier to
remember), and the value should just be a value just like you would
write it on the command line (except that there <EM>must</EM> be a value; for
a boolean value you would have to write explicitly yes/true or
no/false).
<P></P></OL>
<P>Here is an example of what could be written in an .epsmergerc file:</P>
<PRE>
        # Sample epsmerge config file
        o=my_output_file.eps
        rmo = false
        paper = A3
        lmar: 2cm
        rmar: 30mm
        script: '(' . chr( ord('a')+$n ) . ')'</PRE>
<P>If epsmerge doesn't seem to do what you thought it should, take a look
again at your configuration file.  For example, if you redirect stdout,
thinking that your data will go into a file:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge file1.eps file2.eps &gt; new_file.eps</PRE>
<P>but you have forgotten about some <STRONG>o=</STRONG> in your config file, then
epsmerge will write to the <STRONG>o</STRONG> file, leaving <STRONG>new_file.eps</STRONG> empty.  In
this case, you should use the <STRONG>-o</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="further configuration">Further configuration</A></H2>
<P>There are a couple of other things you might want to configure when you
install epsmerge.  These are currently</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The default paper size.
<P></P>
<LI>
The filename-page separator, used to say which pages from a multi-page
postscript file you want to use.  See section <A HREF="#using postscript">Using Postscript</A> below.
<P></P></OL>
<P>These can be configured by editing the epsmerge file <EM>epsmerge</EM>; look
for the section `User serviceable parts'.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="how to generate multiple files">How to generate multiple files</A></H1>
<P>epsmerge can print multiple files as follows: if you call epsmerge with
something like</P>
<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG> <EM>x</EM> <STRONG>-y</STRONG> <EM>y</EM> <STRONG>-o</STRONG> foo.eps filea.eps fileb.eps ...</P>
<P>where the number of input files is greater than the product of <EM>x</EM> and
<EM>y</EM>, then epsmerge will generate several output files.  In the first
file, epsmerge will format the first <EM>xy</EM> input files; the second
output file will contain the next <EM>xy</EM> input files, etc.  (As usual,
if there are not enough input files to fill the last output file
then some of the spaces will be blank.)  Note that all files will be
formatted with <EM>exactly</EM> the same options.</P>
<P>The filenames of the output files will be generated by the given
filename (in the example <STRONG>foo.eps</STRONG>) as follows: If less than 10 files
are generated, then they will be named <STRONG>foo-0.eps</STRONG>, <STRONG>foo-1.eps</STRONG>, etc.
If 10 or more but less than 100 files are generated, then they will be
named <STRONG>foo-00.eps</STRONG>, <STRONG>foo-01.eps</STRONG>, etc.  Thus the output files are
generated in alphabetical order.  And are thus easier to handle
wholesale by the shell as <STRONG>foo-??.eps</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Alternatively, if you use the <STRONG>--postscript</STRONG> option, you will get a
single postscript file with <EM>xy</EM> EPS files formatted on each page.</P>
<P>Unless specified otherwise, this will be decided by looking at the
file's extension: if the file is called <STRONG>foo.eps</STRONG> you get multi-file
EPS'es; if the file is called <STRONG>foo.ps</STRONG> you get single-file multi-page
(non-encapsulated) postscript.
=head1 Examples of usage</P>
<P>These examples assume that you have set up an epsmerge script somewhere
in your path.  See <A HREF="#the path">The Path</A> below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Format five EPS files into one:
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o newfile.eps file-a.eps file-b.eps file-c.eps file-d.eps file-e.eps</PRE>
<P>or let the shell do the job (remember: the shell is your <EM>friend</EM>!)</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o newfile.eps file-?.eps</PRE>
<P></P>
<LI>
Reformat a single EPS file to fit one A4 page with 1 centimetre margins
everywhere and send it to the printer (note the pipe at the end):
<PRE>
        epsmerge -lmar 1cm -rmar 1cm -tmar 1cm -bmar 1cm --print myfile.eps | lpr</PRE>
<P>This time use default margins, but print in landscape mode on letter paper:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -O L -paper letter --print y myfile.eps | lpr</PRE>
<P></P>
<LI>
Format a page with three EPS files in the first row and just two in the second:
<P>First method leaves a space in the lower right corner where the sixth cell should
have been:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o myoutputfile.eps -x 3 -y 2 file-11.eps file-12.eps file-13.eps \
        file-21.eps file-22.eps</PRE>
<P>Second method uses <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> to create temporary files:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o tmp1.eps -x 3 -y 1 file-11.eps file-12.eps file-13.eps
        epsmerge -o tmp2.eps -x 2 -y 1 file-21.eps file-22.eps
        epsmerge -x 1 -y 2 -o myoutputfile.eps tmp1.eps tmp2.eps</PRE>
<P></P>
<LI>
For each included EPS file write below it its name with .eps extension
stripped off, and creation date.  The output file should have filename
and creation date written above all the included EPS files.  The font
sizes should be 20 and 30, respectively:
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o myoutput.eps --labels bFd20 --header tfd30 a.eps b.eps c.eps</PRE>
<P></P>
<LI>
I want to write my EPS files with labels (a), (b), (c), etc.
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o myoutput.eps --labels s --script '&quot;(&quot; . chr( ord(&quot;a&quot;)+$n ) . &quot;)&quot;' a.eps b.eps c.eps d.eps</PRE>
<P>(Note the single quotes preventing the UNIX shell from messing with the
script.  If you are not on a UNIX shell, consult your local system guru
(possibly yourself) for how to prevent the shell from tampering with
your data.)</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
I am confused about the variables available to my script.  What do I do?
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o myoutput.eps --labels sss --headers sss --script '&quot;(\$n,\$l)=($n,$l)&quot;' ?.eps</PRE>
<P>where ?.eps is your favourite selection of simple EPS files.  Note that
the shell strips the outer single quotes, so the inner double quotes say
to Perl: this is an interpolated string.  Also try it without the
<STRONG>--headers</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
I have ten EPS files, and I want them formatted to some files, each
containing four input files.
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o page.eps -x 2 -y 2 firstfile.eps [ ... ] tenthfile.eps</PRE>
<P>This will generate the ouput files <STRONG>page-0.eps</STRONG> (containing the first four
input files), <STRONG>page-1.eps</STRONG> (containing the next four), and <STRONG>page-2.eps</STRONG>
(containing the last two).</P>
<P>Alternatively, generate a single postscript file:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o pages.ps -x 2 -y 2 -ps firstfile.eps [ ... ] tenthfile.eps</PRE>
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="using postscript">Using Postscript</A></H1>
<P>As of version 1.2.4, epsmerge has support for reading non-encapsulated
(i.e., consisting of several pages) postscript (provided that the
postscript file has a bounding box DSC).  By default, it does that with
a postscript file, i.e., if the file <EM>warp-drive.ps</EM> contains eight
pages, then it will get expanded as eight pages in your input.  Example:</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o foo.ps -x 2 -y 2 warp-drive.ps</PRE>
<P>will take the pages of the file <EM>warp-drive.ps</EM> and reformat them
into a postscript file with four of the original pages on each page.</P>
<P>However, you can pick out which pages you actually want, in any order
you want.  Example: if you write</P>
<PRE>
        epsmerge -o foo.ps -x 2 -y 2 bar.eps eek.ps:3,1,5-9,4 moo.eps</PRE>
<P>then epsmerge will generate a three page postscript file with four (two
by two) images on each page; the first image will be <EM>bar.eps</EM>, the
next three images on the first page will be pages 3, 1, and 5 of
<EM>eek.ps</EM>.  The second page will contain pages 6, 7, 8, and 9 of
<EM>eek.ps</EM>.  The third and final page will contain page 4 of <EM>eek.ps</EM>
and <EM>moo.eps</EM>.</P>
<P>Observe that in the specification</P>
<PRE>
        eek.ps:3,1,5-9,4</PRE>
<P>there is <EM>no space</EM> anywhere.  The format is <EM>filename</EM> followed by the
<EM>separator</EM> followed by a sequence of comma-separated numbers in which a dash
between two numbers <EM>5-9</EM> is interpreted as the range <EM>5,6,7,8,9</EM>.  If the
separator is not immediately followed by a sequence of integers as described,
then it is interpreted as a part of the filename.</P>
<P>The above example assumes that the <EM>separator</EM> is the single character
`:'.  However, this might have been changed when epsmerge was installed (see
section <A HREF="#further customization">Further customization</A> for details).  Type</P>

<P><STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> is distributed as several files: the main file and several
files with .pm extension (Perl modules).  If you use <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> often, you may
consider writing a script telling Perl where to find epsmerge.  On a UNIX system
your script could look like this (one line):</P>
<PRE>
        /usr/bin/perl -I/home/foo/epsm/ /home/foo/epsm/epsmerge $@</PRE>
<P>assuming you unpacked epsmerge in the directory /home/foo/epsm and that <EM>perl</EM> is
in /usr/bin.  Make the script executable (with <EM>chmod</EM>) and put it in your path.
If the script is called <EM>epsmerge</EM> then you can go to your favourite EPS directory
and merge away by just writing <EM>epsmerge</EM> (plus all the options and filenames).</P>

<P><STRONG>Bounding Box</STRONG>: Part of Adobe's DSC (qv).  As far as epsmerge is concerned,
this is the most important part of any (encapsulated or not) postscript file.</P>
<P><STRONG>DSC</STRONG>: Document Structuring Conventions.  Adobe's DSC specify how an EPS file
is formatted by requiring certain comments, all starting with %% and then a
keyword.  Example: '%%BoundingBox: 0 0 485 384'.</P>
<P><STRONG>EPS</STRONG>: Encapsulated Postscript.  This is a file that contains postscript commands
to draw a figure which may later be included in other postscript documents.  The
first line of an EPS file must look something like '%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0'.
Observe that, unlike postscript files, an EPS file can only be <EM>one</EM> page.</P>
<P><STRONG>Perl</STRONG>: Practical Extraction and Report Language.  Or as its many fans will
have it: Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister.  Chosen for portability; although
developed for a UNIX (Linux) system, <STRONG>epsmerge</STRONG> <EM>might</EM> run happily on many
other platforms (currently it doesn't, though).  Oh, and Perl is <EM>fun</EM>, too.

<LI>
Does not recognize nested documents.  Not that I've ever seen any anyway.
<P></P>
<LI>
Doesn't yet support page specific DSC, like %%PageOrientation or
%%Begin(End)PageSetup, etc.
<P></P>
<LI>
Doesn't include header-specific setup information, such as
'%%DocumentNeededFonts' in the final EPS file.
<P></P>
<LI>
Using the stack formatter with options from the other formatter is,
cough, undefined.  In fact, the stack formatter is a bit of a hack.
Expect unusual behaviour occasionally.
