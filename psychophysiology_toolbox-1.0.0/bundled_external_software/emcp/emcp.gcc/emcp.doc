This file contains documentation for EMCP, a version of Gabriele Gratton's 
eye movement correction developed at the University of Illinois Cognitive 
Psychophysiology Laboratory (CPL).  

This version is based on EMCPX, which was written by James Turner, in 1993
for AIX and the IBM RS-6000.

Subsequent modifications were made by Brian Foote and Kevin Spencer.
Bill Gehring ported EMCPX to DOS using DJGPP, and added Neuroscan 
data file support.  Brian Foote reincorporated this code into
the CPL's EMCP, and did additional ports to Borland C++ and Microsoft C++.

EMCP uses Neuroscan, Inc. EEG files (single-trial epoched 
data produced by Neuroscan's Acquire and Edit programs).  It also requires
some other input files, one of which is optional. It corrects
the EEG data for vertical and horizontal ocular movement and blink 
artifacts and produces an EEG file compatible with NeuroScan's analysis
software.   It is compatible with other data formats used
with previous versions of this program.

The procedure is reported in:

method for off-line removal of ocular artifact.  Electroencephalography
and Clinical Neurophysiology, 55, 468-484.  

A distribution of this program for the RT11 operating system 
FORTRAN IV is reported in:

implementation of an eye movement correction procedure.  Psychophysiology,
25, 241-243.

Documentation available with the Miller distribution goes into much more detail
than is possible here.  Part of that distribution is included here 
(EMF11P.TXT and EMF11P.GID) and it includes some revision notes that 
are informative.  Potential users should note that a number of conventions 
have been adopted over the years (such as the blink detection criterion 
EOGSEN, discussed in the Miller distribution).  Because the program has 
evolved over many versions and operating systems, no one person remembers or 
understands all of the conventions.  (Thanks to Greg Miller for permission to 
include EMF11P.TXT and EMF11P.GID).

COMMAND LINE SYNTAX:

DJEMCP requires 2 input files: a cardfile that contains parameters
specifying input and output format, and a data file containing single
trials from an ERP experiment.  For NeuroScan users, this will be a .EEG
file.  It also allows you to specify whether the screen output will be 
be verbose and whether to use a "Beckman calibration" (something that was
apparently necessary at the CPL but will be of no use to most users).
A final optional argument is the calibration file, which is documented below.
The version as compiled by DJGPP requires a DPMI host.  CWSDPMI is free
and included with djgpp (see http://www.delorie.com).  The easiest way
to get DPMI services without CWSDPMI is to run the program from a DOS window
in Windows 3.1.

the syntax is:

	djemcp <+/->v<b> <parameter file> <data file> <calibration file>

	(+v = verbose on, -v = verbose off, /b = Beckman calibration)

example as used in my laboratory:

	cwsdpmi
	djemcp +v s201.crd test.eeg

Output files:

	The current version produces fewer output files than some versions
of EMCP.  In particular, corrected and uncorrected averages are not produced.
Appropriate lines of code in nsfiles.c can be un-commented and these will
be produced, but they will not be compatible with NeuroScan programs.

	In the current version, if the input file is test.eeg, the 
output files produced would be:

	testc.eeg	corrected single trials
	test.log	log file

***************************************************************************

TEST BATCH FILES

To test the programs on your system, you can use the batch files "dj.bat" and "wat.bat"
in the testdata directory.  The single trial output files will be comparable to c1s12l01.sng
(see "test" documentation below).

***************************************************************************

NOTES ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION

1)  The current version was written to retain compatibility with previous
data formats.  For the analysis of Neuroscan files, however, much of the
input cardfile is not necessary.

2)  I have included some files that you may use to test modifications
of this code, to ensure that the output is the same as 
produced by previous versions.  The tests that were performed are documented
below.

3)  This version was compiled and tested using djgpp version 2, an MS-DOS
port of the gnu gcc C compiler that requires DPMI services. It is 
on the world wide web at http://www.delorie.com. Use of this
required adding "__attribute__ ((packed))" in a number of places in the 
header file sethead.h (available from NeuroScan).  Note that djgpp version 1 
is not recommended because it chokes on the command line arguments used with
emcp.  

	DPMI services can be provided either by running the program in a
DOS window of Windows 3.1 or by running the program CWSDPMI before 
running DJEMCP.  CWSDPMI can be obtained at the website above.

4) NeuroScan EEG data files are in short format, and integer overflows can 
happen after correction when the data (stored as floats) are
converted back to short integers, e.g., if the digitizer was close to 
saturated before correction and then correction pushed the
data over the top.  Output data are scanned for overflow in nsfiles.c
If overflow is detected, program tries to subtract a baseline consisting of
the average activity during the entire epoch.  If there is still an
overflow, the trial is rejected (rejection flag set to 6 and set all the data 
set to 0).  These trials will show up as rejected in NeuroScan's EDIT
module.

5) For all input formats except NeuroScan, trials that are rejected because
of flat or out-of-scale EEG or EOG are not written to the output file.  For
the NeuroScan input format, however, >all< trials are written to the output 
file.  Trials with flat or out-of-scale data are marked as "rejected" and 
will show up that way in the EDIT program.  Keeping the bad trials in the 
output is done for a couple of reasons:  sequential analyses where one trial 
is classified on the basis of the behavior on previous trials may depend on
non-EEG information (e.g. squeeze force) on the previous trial.  Also,
output files produced this way are exactly the same size as EEG files, 
which provides a check on the success of the EMCP run.

6)  If the number of sweeps is too large for current memory limits, the
program will crash.  

7)  Other causes of crashing may include incorrect input parameters.

8)  Three compiled versions are included:

Gehring's DJEMCP version was compiled with djgpp (a port of the gnu
gcc comipiler to DOS) and tested on a Dell Optiplex 90 MHz Pentium 
with 16Mb RAM.  

EMCP.EXE was compiled with Watcom version 11.

Both versions have been tested under Windows NT 4.0

Note:  10/11/99:  Borland and Visual C/C++ compiled versions are no longer included.


***************************************************************************

Assumptions of the current version:

1)  The EEG file input filename should have no more than 7 letters in the
prefix.  Output files will append that prefix with a "c" to denote
that the data have been corrected.  Thus, DATA001.EEG will yield
the output file DATA001c.EEG.

2)  For EEG files, the current version assumes that one channel 
in the input is called "VEOG" and another is called "HEOG" and a third 
is "FZ." For other formats, this information is defined in the header
file emcp.h.  If your EEG file does not have the proper names, the 
defaults in emcp.h will be used.  (You can also change electrode names
using the NeuroScan's EDIT program.)

PARAMETER FILE:

	For non-SYNAMPS formats, the input parameter file (or "card file")
contains important information about the input and output data formats.  
The logfile will contain much of this information as read by the 
program -- useful for debugging purposes.  

The parameters marked * can be set to 0 for .EEG files derived from
a NeuroScan system.  Parameters marked # are additional parameters
that can be set to 0 for SYNAMPS systems.

Here is a description of the information in c1s12ns.crd.  (see TEST 2
above).  Note that the actual file should be one value per line.

                                                from each single trial.

*****************************************************************************
CHANNEL SPECIFICATIONS

The traditional method for specifying channels was for EMCP to assume that the 
first 2 channels were ocular movement channels, some number of other channels
were EEG channels to be corrected, and the remainder should be left alone 
(useful for EMG, analog response devices, and stimulus markers).  The 
parameters above are set up to be consistent with this early format:  
Total Channels is the total number of Channels, and Number of EEG channels 
indicates the number of channels to correct (following the first 2 EOG 
channels).  Exactly which channels are the EOG channels are now specified in
the file emcp.h.  (Any of the first "Number of EEG Channels"+2 can be VEOG 
or HEOG).

For NeuroScan input format, however, DJEMCP assumes that all channels will be 
corrected except for those whose labels appear on the "Channels to be left 
alone" line  (see SYNAMPS example below).  It assumes that vertical eye 
movement has the VEOG label and horizontal has an HEOG label.  It also 
requires a channel with the FZ label.  (That channel is used to recover some 
out-of-scale EOG values and thus it's best if it really is Fz).

*****************************************************************************
EOG SENSITIVITY

The sensitivity of the EOG channel, in A/D per microvolt, is used to compute
a criterion that determines whether EOG activity is classified as a blink or
as a saccade.  Note that a slope is determined using this value multiplied
a scaling factor that is 14.0 in the present version. Greg Miller's release
of EMCP for RT11 contains extensive documentation on this and its history.
If this value is specified in the NeuroScan file, this parameter should be
set to 0 in the cardfile.

*****************************************************************************

ALTERNATIVE INPUT FORMATS.

Two different types of input formats besides NeuroScan .EEG can be used, 
and each can be in binary or ascii format.  Note that these are normally only
useful for analyzing the data in some other system -- analysis with NeuroScan's
software only requires .EEG input and output formats. 

1)  CPL format.  This format stores a string of identification values with
each channel.  The file is arranged as follows, for a file with 3 IDs and
440 points per channel, with two trials and 3 channels:

Trial 1 Chan 1: 	ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440
Trial 1 Chan 2:		ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440
Trial 1 Chan 3:		ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440
Trial 2 Chan 1: 	ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440
Trial 2 Chan 2:		ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440
Trial 2 Chan 3:		ID1 ID2 ID3 Point1-Point440	

The program EEGTOASC creates a file in this format from a
NeuroScan EEG file.  The IDs created are:
	ID1 = Trial
	ID2 = Trial Type (can be used for averaging bin definitions)
	ID3 = Channel Number
An example is the c1s12l01.asc file provided with the test program
(see TEST #1).  

2)  PC format.  This format stores a string of identification values with
each channel.  The file is arranged as follows, for a file with 3 IDs and
440 points per channel, with two trials and N channels:

Point 1:	ID1 ID2 ID3 Channel1 Channel 2 Channel 3
Point 2:	ID1 ID2 ID3 Channel1 Channel 2 Channel 3
      .
Point 440:	ID1 ID2 ID3 Channel1 Channel 2 Channel 3

3)  .EEG input but CPL or PC output.

If you use .EEG as input and produce one of the following output formats,
the IDs will correspond to the 3 IDs indicated in #1 above.

***************************************************************************

SELECTION CARDS.

Selection cards are used to describe the averaging bins. Traditional
use of EMCP created average ERPs according to these bins, but this
facility is commented out in the present version.  These averaging bins
are still important however, because they determine the average waveform that
is subtracted from each single trial before correction factors are computed.
(The idea is that the correction factors should not be influenced by 
event-related ERP activity).  In older formats, defining the bins was handled 
by "IDs" and thus the selection card format is based on a format like I1=1,
meaning that trials where the value of ID1 is 1 will be included in the 
averaging bin.

The selection card format is documented in scard.c and selectc.c. The format
"i2=21" says that the trials where ID #2 is 21 (or in the case of neuroscan 
files where the Trial type code is 21) will all be grouped into one average.
What I normally do is determine the most important experimental manipulations
and supply EMCP with selection cards that will describe those as separate
bins.  In the example above, I2=21 could be tones with probability .20,
I2=22 could be tones with probability .30 and I2=23 could be probability .50.

In djemcp, Neuroscan ID and event codes are converted internally to ID codes.
Selection cards can be specified by the trial number using the first ID 
value (e.g., I1<10) or by the event code number (I2,as in the previous 
paragraph).

****************************************************************************
A TYPICAL RUN:

Here is an example cardfile that we're using with our SYNAMPs system.  Note
that some of the values are replaced by information in the NeuroScan headers.

***************************************************************

Calibration file:

The program CAN (optionally) use a calibration file, specified
on the command line, where each line in the file represents the 
A/D points per microvolt for the corresponding channel.  Only EEG and
EOG channels (as specified by the numEEG.Channels value in the card file)
are calibrated in this manner.  Normally with SYAMPS you won't use
this because of the internal calibration, and NeuroScan provides
ways for you to take advantage of internal calibration with
non-SYNAMPS systems.  DO NOT USE THIS OPTION IF YOU INTEND TO 
KEEP THE ANALYSIS WITHIN THE NEUROSCAN FORMAT.  THE PRESENT VERSION DOES 
NOT PRODUCE EEG FILES WITH THE CORRECT CALIBRATION GIVEN AN EXTERNAL 
CALIBRATION FILE. It should not be difficult to modify the program to do 
this, but there has been no need for this yet. In other words,
only use this option if you intend to produce a CPL or PC version
output file.

********************************************************************

TESTS

The following files were provided by Leun Otten of the 
Cognitive Psychophysiology laboratory for testing purposes.
The input files are ASCII and .EEG format data from their
neuroscan system.  The output files are those created with 
the emcpx program (as of August 1995) as run on CPL's RS-6000
and as such should be considered the Gold Standard for verifying
the accuracy of any modifications to this version of emcp.

c1s12.cal	input calibration file, A/D points per microvolt for
                	each channel

c1s12l01.asc	input file in ascii format that is equivalent to
                c1s12l01.txt

note:  PC version does not produce average output files (.cav or .rav)		

*************************************************************************

Note that the tests below all made use of calibration information 
provided by the calibration file.  This is not normally necessary 
with NeuroScan's SYNAMPS system because calibration is performed by 
ACQUIRE and the calibration factors as stored with the file are used by 
emcp.

*************************************************************************

TEST 1:  ASCII to ASCII

To test the program, the first comparison showed the
ability of the program to take the ascii file c1s12l01.txt
and produce the same outputs as CPL's emcpx.  
Because c1s12l01.txt has 8 letters in the prefix, I used 
a copy of it named c1s12lt.txt for testing.  I also had
to modify the cardfile to be compatible with the
current input format.

This test was performed with the following commands:

	cwsdpmi
        copy c1s12l01.txt c1s12lt.txt
	djemcp +v c1s12new.crd c1s12lt.txt c1s12.cal 

Input:
	c1s12new.crd	a modification of c1s12.crd for compatibility
				with current parameter format
	c1s12lt.txt	c1s12l01.txt renamed to 7 letter prefix.
	c1s12.cal	same calibration file as used by CPL's emcpx

Output:
	c1s12lt.txt	input file
	c1s12lt.log	log file
	c1s12lt.sng	single trials output

Note:  The batch files "dj.bat" and "wat.bat" in the testdata 
directory perform this test, producing the files dj.sng and wat.sng.

TEST 2:  EEG to EEG

The next step was to test the capability of the program to take
Leun's EEG file and produce an EEG file equivalent to the
ASCII file produced by CPL's emcpx.  This checks the conversion
from EEG format to the format used by emcpx.  To do this, I had
to 

 1 - modify emcp to produce float (rather than short) binary
      output.  This was done using the presently commented-out
	code "special purpose for test" in files.c
 2 - run that output through feegtoas.c to create an ascii version
 3 - compare that to the single trial output c1s12l01.sng.

This test was performed with the following commands:

        copy c1s12l01.eeg c1s1201.eeg
	cwsdpmi
	djemcp +v c1s12ns.crd c1s1201.eeg c1s12.cal
        mv c1s1201c.eeg c1s1201f.eeg
	feegtoas c1s1201f.eeg c1s1201a.eeg

Note that the output is scaled differently than the input, because
of the calibration (which does not end up being correct).

Input:
	c1s12ns.crd	card file modified for this analysis
	c1s1201.eeg	input EEG file - a copy of c1s12l01.eeg
                        	renamed to a shorter prefix.
	c1s12.cal	same cal file as before

Output:

	c1s1201.log	log file
	c1s1201f.eeg	eeg file output in float format (not compatible 
                                 with neuroscan).
Other:
	c1s1201a.eeg	float format EEG after conversion to ascii 
                             (for comparison to c1s12l01.sng)

        c1s1201c.eeg    regular Neuroscan-compatible output file, from
                        a separate run using the usualy short integer output
                        (using the djemcp command line above).

TEST 3:  EEG to ASCII

This tests the capability of the program to take a .EEG input file
and produce an ASCII output equivalent to that produced by emcpx.

Commands:
	cwsdpmi
	djemcp +v c1s12n-c.crd c1s1201.eeg c1s12.cal 

Input:
	c1s1201.eeg	a copy of c1s12l01.eeg
	c1s12n-c.crd	card file for this analysis
	c1s12.cal	same calibrations as before

Output:
	c1s1201c.asc	corrected single trials in ascii format (renamed
                               after the run from c1s1201.sng).


Note that (as compiled by djgpp) djemcp produces ascii output that
is slightly different from c1s12l01.sng (the output of emcpx as compiled
on the RS/6000 AIX system).  In particular, line 714 of the PC output 
file "c1s1201c.asc" has 22.806 where the AIX output file "c1s12l01.sng" 
has the value 22.805.  This difference is due to an apparent difference in 
the rounding convention adopted by printf function in each of the two 
compilers.  the actual number is 22.80550 in both cases.  djgpp uses IEEE 
standard 754, which is described in this excerpt from the mail archives:

printf will "...round correctly after IEEE standard 754, which means that
numbers ending with 5 are rounded to the next even number.
So 1.15 will round to  1.2, 1.25 will round to 1.2 and 1.35 will round
to 1.4. (Of course 1.250000001 will still round to 1.3)."

Other rounding differences are apparent.  These are listed below:

Line 1405  DJEMCP:  0.000;  EMCPX:  -0.000;  Actual:  -0.00003
Line 3337  DJEMCP: -25.578; EMCPX: -25.579;  Actual: -25.57850
Line 4762  DJEMCP: -0.001;  EMCPX:  -0.000;  Actual:  -0.00089

TEST 4:  Normal run EEG to EEG.

This is not a comparison to Leun's data, but rather a demonstration
of a typical run of EMCP, without the calibration factors.  The input
file is the same 15 trial .EEG file, c1s1201.eeg, renamed as nocalib.eeg.
In this case the output is scaled the same as the input.  Note that with
these very few trials, djemcp does reasonable blink correction, but that
it does not deal very well with the one horizontal eye movement.

Commands:
	cwsdpmi
	djemcp +v nocalib.crd nocalib.eeg

Input:
	nocalib.eeg	a copy of c1s12l01.eeg
	nocalib.crd	card file for this analysis

Output
	nocalibc.eeg	corrected single trials, compatible with SCAN.
	nocalib.log	log file
