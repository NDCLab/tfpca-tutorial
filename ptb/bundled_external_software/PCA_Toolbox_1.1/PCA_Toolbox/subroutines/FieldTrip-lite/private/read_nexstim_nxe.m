function [dat] = read_nexstim_nxe(filename, begsample, endsample, chanindx)

% READ_NEXSTIM_NXE reads specified samples from a NXE continous datafile
%
% Use as
%   [hdr] = read_nexstim_nxe(filename)
% where
%    filename        name of the datafile, including the .bdf extension
% This returns a header structure with the following elements
%   hdr.Fs           sampling frequency
%   hdr.nChans       number of channels
%   hdr.nSamples     number of samples per trial
%   hdr.nSamplesPre  number of pre-trigger samples in each trial
%   hdr.nTrials      number of trials
%   hdr.label        cell-array with labels of each channel
%
% Or use as
%   [dat] = read_nexstim_nxe(filename, begsample, endsample, chanindx)
% where
%    filename        name of the datafile, including the .nxe extension
%    begsample       index of the first sample to read
%    endsample       index of the last sample to read
%    chanindx	     index of channels to read (optional, default is all)
% This returns a Nchans X Nsamples data matrix
